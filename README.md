# Monte-Carlo-Simulations

This is my exploratory program for the random walk model. I created it for my Computational Solid State physics class.

[In case you are not familiar with the random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk)

*What the code does:*
1. Plot the random walk of a particle for N steps
2. Find the mean square distance from the beginning after N steps
3. Insert traps in the grid
4. A bunch of other stuff

## Here's a picture of my result:
